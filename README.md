# Scroll Snap Carousel

## :warning: This project is a WIP!

Scroll Snap Carousel is a carousel based on **native CSS Scroll Snap**.
It is dependency free with vanilla JS at its core, but comes with support for various frameworks.
It's a rework of [react-snaplist-carousel](https://github.com/luispuig/react-snaplist-carousel) in vanilla JS.

- **Smoother than ever** since it uses native CSS Scroll Snap, scroll behaviour basically can't be smoother!
- **Native scroll experience** trackpad scroll, touch swipe, etc. all of this comes for natively, without cost, thanks to CSS Scroll Snap.
- **Lightweight** it really doesn't do much.
- **Works everywhere** with plugins for React, Svelte, Vue and Angular (soon?).
