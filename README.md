# Snap Carousel

Snap Carousel is a helper to enhance the native [CSS Scroll Snap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Scroll_Snap) experience. If you ever wanted to use CSS Scroll Snap to create a carousel but were missing basic features like "active dots" indicator and drag scroll, this is for you!

### Getting started

- [Core documentation](https://github.com/Grsmto/scroll-snap-carousel/tree/master/packages/core)

If you are using a framework, SimpleBar also supports the most popular ones: Vue, Angular and React.

- [React documentation](https://github.com/Grsmto/scroll-snap-carousel/tree/master/packages/react)
- [Svelte documentation](https://github.com/Grsmto/scroll-snap-carousel/tree/master/packages/svelte)

### Demo

### Limitations

WIP

## :warning: This project is a WIP!

Snap Carousel is a carousel based on **native CSS Scroll Snap**.
It is dependency free with vanilla JS at its core, but comes with integrations for React and Svelte (please contribute to implement other frameworks!).

- **Smoother than ever** since it uses native CSS Scroll Snap, scroll behaviour basically can't be smoother!
- **Native scroll experience** trackpad scroll, touch swipe, etc. all of this comes for natively, without cost, thanks to CSS Scroll Snap.
- **Lightweight** it really doesn't do much.
- **Works everywhere** with plugins for React, Svelte, Vue and Angular (soon?).

## Credits

Snap Carousel is a rework of [react-snaplist-carousel](https://github.com/luispuig/react-snaplist-carousel) in vanilla JS. Kudos to @luispuig.
